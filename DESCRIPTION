Description: A data structure similar to dictionaries in Python or hashes in 
    other languages is implemented adapted to R's accessors syntax and 
    vectorized operations. For objects of appreciable size, hashes outperform
    native named lists and vectors. A comprehensive set of functions,
    methods and objects make hashes easy-to-use.
