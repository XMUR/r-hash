Description: This package implements a data structure similar to dictionaries
    in Python or hashes in Perl and other languages.  The implementation, while
    closely following these other accomodates R's accessors and vectorized
    semantics. For objects of appreciable size, hashes outperform
    native named lists and vectors for lookups. A comprehensive set of functions
    methods and object make hashes flexible and easy to use.
